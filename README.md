# SpeakIT

SpeakIT 2.0
(Final Solo Project for the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp)

Website [https://speak-it-2.herokuapp.com/](here)

We've all wanted to learn different languages but the existing methods (classes, online tutorials, etc.) don't cut it for learning how to speak conversationally; I wanted to create an experience where users can connect to learn from fluent speakers of other languages and at the same time make new friends. 

Design is both unique and simplistic. App is mobile-friendly and comfortable to use on any size of screen.

All app is built around user. 

* Comfortable UI, responsive navbar with intuitive icons and clean material animations.

* Indicating users' online status with a green ring around the avatar.

* Interactive map on profile page (with colored countries when user has a friend from there)

* Incoming and outgoing friend requests

* Live chat with persistent history.


More details will be added by 8/20/2018
